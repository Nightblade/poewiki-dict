# poewiki-dict

This repository provides spell-checker dictionaries for Firefox and Chrome, specifically tailored for editing articles on [poewiki.net](https://www.poewiki.net).

# Limitations

The spell-checker dictionaries in this repository are generated from [CSpell](https://www.github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell) dictionary files; by default, CSpell ignores words less than **four** characters long, and handles possessives (`'s`) automatically.  By contrast, the spell-checkers in Firefox & Chrome ignore words less than **three** characters long, and do **not** handle possessives (`'s`) automatically.

(Also, Firefox & Chrome are case-sensitive, but I have addressed this by adding each word twice with alternating capitalization, with the exception of ALLCAPS words.)

# Installation

## Firefox
* Download [persdict.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nightblade/poewiki-dict/main/persdict.dat)
* Move/copy it to your `profile directory`.
	To quickly find your profile directory:
	* Type `about:support` into the browser's address bar,
	* Next to `Profile Folder`, click `Open Folder`.

## Chrome
* Download [Custom Dictionary.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nightblade/poewiki-dict/main/Custom%20Dictionary.txt)
* Move/copy it to your `profile directory`.
* Delete any existing `Custom Dictionary.txt.backup` file.  (This is to stop Chrome trying to restore this file and overwriting your new file).
	To find your profile directory:
	* Type `about:version` into the browser's address bar,
	* Copy the text next to `Profile Path:`,
	* Paste this into an Explorer window or equivalent.
