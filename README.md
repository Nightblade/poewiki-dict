This repo provides a spell-checker dictionary-file that can be used while editing articles on [`poewiki.net`](https://www.poewiki.net).  It contains words & names specific to [`Path of Exile`](https://www.pathofexile.com) together with words commonly used while editing pages on [`Mediawiki`](https://www.mediawiki.org)-based sites.

<u>**Note:**  This is a WIP and currently only supports `Firefox`.</u>

# Specifics
The main file ([`persdict.dat`](https://github.com/Nightblade/poewiki-dict/blob/main/persdict.dat)) is meant to replace your "personal dictionary" file in Firefox.

As Firefox's personal dictionary is case-sensitive, all words are included twice to reduce false spelling errors.   Words that are **ALLCAPS** are the exception.

# Installation
* Download [`persdict.dat`](https://github.com/Nightblade/poewiki-dict/blob/main/persdict.dat) 
* Move/copy to your `profile directory`.  
	To quickly find it:
	* Type `about:support` into the FF address bar,
	* Next to `Profile Folder` click `Open Folder`
